# CodeCraftHub – AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform (Back-End)
**Created By:** Tim Snyder  
**Role:** Solo Developer emulating a back-end engineer on a product team  

This project is one of my final portfolio projects in the Coursera/IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate program. For portfolio use, I am recreating the final project from the course and hosting it myself so prospective employers can see the back-end architecture, code generation, and AI-assisted workflow I developed.

> **NOTE:** Hosting details will be added once deployment is complete.  

**App URL:** *Coming Soon*

## Project Overview
CodeCraftHub is a personalized learning platform designed for developers. This back-end project focuses on building the **server-side architecture** that powers CodeCraftHub, leveraging **Generative AI**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB** to deliver intelligent and adaptive learning experiences.

The goal of this project is to emulate working as a back-end engineer within a development team — designing, developing, testing, and deploying scalable server-side components using modern development practices and AI assistance.

---

## Coursera/IBM Project Scope
The final project challenge provided the foundation and learning objectives for this implementation:

- Design and develop software applications using **Generative AI**
- Create project documentation using **Generative AI**
- Generate and execute **test cases** with AI assistance
- Deploy the fully developed back-end application
- Apply full-stack software engineering practices in a simulated team environment

---

## My Work
As the sole developer on this recreation, I am responsible for the full back-end development lifecycle, including:

- Architecting the **Node.js and Express.js server-side components** and **API endpoints**
- Implementing **MongoDB data modeling** for user and course information
- Integrating **Generative AI** into the workflow for documentation, test creation, and feature scaffolding
- Using **Postman** for API testing and validation
- Setting up **Docker** for containerization and deployment readiness
- Managing source control and collaboration tools through **GitHub**

---

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js** – Core runtime for server-side logic and API development  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing user profiles, learning paths, and content  
- **Postman** – API testing and validation environment  
- **Python** – Supporting scripts and AI integrations  
- **Docker** – Containerization for environment consistency and deployment  
- **Generative AI Tools** – Used for documentation, code generation, and test case creation  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project collaboration  

---

## Future Work
- Integration with a front-end client (to be added once available)  
- Full deployment pipeline setup (Render/Heroku/AWS TBD)  
- Expanded AI-powered personalization features  

---

## About This Project
This project showcases my ability to:
- Design back-end architectures with scalability in mind  
- Incorporate **Generative AI** throughout the software development lifecycle  

This work highlights not just technical execution, but also my focus on *AI-augmented development workflows*, documentation quality, and maintainable system design.
